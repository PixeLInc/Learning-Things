# Learning languages and such
In this repo, there will be info that I've discovered in my journey of learning said language.\
Not everything will be there, such as super simple syntax, types, etc unless I'm not familiar.\
Only the things that I personally don't know all too well or are a bit different will be there.

Everything will normally be seperated via language folder, and then the respective sub folders of the things\
that will be included so it doesn't get super unorganized.
